The font used in this project is "itf Qomra Arabic" officially adopted by the new Syrian government.

As the font is commercially licensed with an estimated value of approximately $1,500 USD, it has been embedded in the project in an encrypted Base64 format to preserve intellectual property rights and avoid violating licensing terms.



This approach ensures proper interface rendering within the development and review environment, without direct distribution of the original font file.



We kindly ask reviewers and evaluators to take this into consideration and refrain from using or redistributing the font outside the scope of this project.



Respectfully,
Mouayad MHD Samer Zaweet
