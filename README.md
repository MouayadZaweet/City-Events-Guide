# City Events Guide

Important Notice:

The overall design of this project was inspired by the visual identity of the official website of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, with carefully considered modifications tailored to the nature and purpose of the platform.

The color palette is derived from national symbols and was thoughtfully selected to achieve visual balance and clarity, while maintaining a formal yet modern aesthetic.

The font used is "itf Qomra Arabic," a paid and officially endorsed typeface with an estimated value of approximately $1,500 USD. It has been embedded in the project in encrypted Base64 format to preserve intellectual property rights and ensure compliance with licensing terms.

From a technical perspective, the inspiration drawn from the Ministry’s website was not mere imitation, but rather a reflection of my personal ambition to become a high-level developer who adheres to the highest professional standards and prepares for elite employment environments.

For this reason, the project was built entirely from scratch without relying on any pre-made frameworks such as Bootstrap, in order to demonstrate full control over fine-grained details and deliver a uniquely customized user experience.

Reviewers and evaluators are kindly requested to take these points into consideration and to refrain from using or redistributing any protected assets outside the scope of this project.

Respectfully,
Mouayad MHD Samer Zaweet
